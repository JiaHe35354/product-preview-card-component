## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this component, I practiced:

- Using CSS Grid to change the layout to two-column for desktop version

- Structuring CSS into multiple files to make it more readable

- Using the picture element to provide different images for responsive design.

- Using overflow: hidden to hide any part of an image that extends beyond its parent container

Here's a small snippet I'm proud of:

```html
<picture class="img-hero">
  <source
    media="(min-width: 1000px)"
    srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
  />
  <img src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="Photo of perfume" />
</picture>
```

```css
@media (min-width: 62.5em) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    max-width: 60rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about layout for different screen sizes, as well as responsive images and icons.
